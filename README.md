# Chatbot Project

Welcome to the Chatbot Project! This project aims to develop a conversational chatbot using natural language processing techniques and machine learning. The chatbot is designed to engage with users, answer their queries, and provide assistance based on predefined intents.

## Features

- **Intent Recognition:** The chatbot recognizes user intents based on input patterns and responds accordingly.
- **Context Handling:** Context is maintained during conversations to provide more relevant responses.
- **Scalability:** The chatbot architecture is designed to scale with additional intents and features.
- **Customization:** Easily customizable with new intents, responses, and patterns.

## Getting Started

1. **Training the Model:** Train the chatbot model using the provided dataset or your custom dataset. Use appropriate preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to train the model.

2. **Testing the Chatbot:** Once the model is trained, test the chatbot by interacting with it. Evaluate its performance and fine-tune as necessary.
